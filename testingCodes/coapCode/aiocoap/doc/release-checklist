Notes to the maintainer on what to do during a release
======================================================

* Update NEWS file
* Bump versions in aiocoap/meta.py, and at the head of NEWS
* Commit: git commit -m "Prepare $VERSION release"
* Tag it: git tag -as "$VERSION" -m "$VERSION"
* Clean up: git stash -u; git clean -fxd
* Build it: python3 -m build
  (This builds, by default, both tar ball and wheel)
* Upload it: twine upload ./dist/aiocoap-"$VERSION"{.tar.gz,-py3-none-any.whl}
* Push it: git push github master --tags; git push gitlab master --tags
* log in to readthedocs, add new tag as new version
* Bump versions to add a ".post0"
  * Commit that: git commit -m "Bump version to .post0 to indicate development"

    (This serves to indicate that anything built from git is not identical to
    the last release.)
